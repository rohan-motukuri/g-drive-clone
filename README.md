# Cloud File Storage Platform - A Google Drive Clone

This project is a Google Drive clone that aims to replicate both the functionality and appearance of Google Drive. It's been developed as an #upskilling-project to familiarize myself with React JS and fundamental web development concepts. Throughout the project, I gained valuable insights into the following areas:

- Utilizing states in React
- Implementing user authentication
- Managing Firebase database and storage
- Designing modals for interactive user experiences
- Version control using Git
- Understanding the importance of separating functionality into paradigms such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), which the current project lacks, resulting in limitations such as :
  - Safe file uploads
  - Folder uploads
  - Batch downloading
  - Effective and secure storage and database management
